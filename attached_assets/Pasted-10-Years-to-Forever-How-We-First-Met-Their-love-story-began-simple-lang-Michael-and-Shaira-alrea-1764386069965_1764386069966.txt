10 Years to Forever
How We First Met
Their love story began simple lang—
Michael and Shaira already knew each other back in 2011, but they never really paid attention to each other. They had their own worlds, their own circles, their own lives. Just familiar faces passing by.
Pero destiny had its own sweet timing.
Three years later, Michael unexpectedly messaged Shaira on Facebook with a simple yet meaningful, “Kumusta na?”
What started as a casual chat soon turned into something magical. From constant conversations to kilig exchanges, from calling him “prinsipe” to “baby,” a friendship slowly blossomed into a love that felt beautifully inevitable.

February 1, 2016 marked the beginning of forever.
High above the city lights inside the MOA Eye ferris wheel, Shaira said “yes,” officially sealing their relationship.
And as a symbol of that new chapter, Shaira gave Michael a special gift — something simple yet full of meaning. It carried the design and words “FOREVER STARTS NOW.” Little did they know, that message would become a promise their hearts would keep for the next 10 years… and beyond.
It was a night filled with warmth, laughter, and the unshakable feeling that this is where a beautiful forever truly begins.
Our 1st Anniversary in Tagaytay
A year later, their love had only grown deeper.
 To celebrate their 1st anniversary, Michael and Shaira traveled to Sky Ranch, Tagaytay, enjoying the cool air, bright lights, and each other’s company. It became one of those simple yet unforgettable memories—full of joy, photos, rides, and quiet gratitude for the journey they had already begun.
Our First Taste of Distance
Soon after, life brought its first big test. On August 27, 2016—Shaira’s birthday—Michael had to leave for work as a seafarer.
While Shaira continued teaching at Pasay Science, Michael journeyed across oceans and foreign shores. What followed were five contracts of long-distance love—months apart, tearful goodbyes, heartfelt messages, late-night video calls, and days marked by longing and faith.
It wasn’t easy—may mga gabing umiiyak, may mga araw na sobrang miss nila ang isa’t isa—but their love remained steady. The distance didn’t weaken them; it deepened their trust, strengthened their patience, and proved how much they were willing to fight for each other.

In God’s perfect timing, after years of waiting and loving from afar, Michael knew it was time.
 On December 12, 2023, he brought Shaira back to the place where their journey officially began—the MOA Eye ferris wheel.
With the same city lights glowing around them, he asked the most beautiful question:
 “Shaira, will you marry me?”
